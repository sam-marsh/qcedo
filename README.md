Generates exact quantum circuits for exponentiating diagonal operators. Supports symbolics.

For example, here is a circuit for ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e%5E%7B-i%20t%20%5Chat%7BH%7D%7D) with

Supply a function that maps *i â†’ H<sub>i,i</sub>* and the program will output QASM code for the circuit implementing *e<sup>i H</sup>*.

Note this is a work in progress -- the CNOT gates still need to be optimised. Once complete, there will be at most one CNOT between any two given phase gates.
